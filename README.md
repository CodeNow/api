Application Components
==========
#### Express
/lib/express-app.js

#### Routes
/lib/routes/**/*.js

#### Mongo
Models  - /lib/models/mongo/*.js
Schemas - /lib/models/mongo/schemas/*.js

#### Tests
Behavioral tests (BDD) - /test
Unit Tests - /unit
Lab - Testing Framework - [hapijs/lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab)

Running Tests
=============

Run all tests:
```
npm test
```

Granular:

Lint: `npm run lint`
All BDD: `npm run bdd`
Pass additional arguments to BDD: `npm run bdd -- -d`
BDD one file: `npm run bdd -- test/path/to/file.js`
BDD Watch: `npm run bdd-watch`
BDD Watch w/ one test file: `npm run bdd-watch -- test/path/to/file.js`
All Unit: `npm run unit`

Opinions
========
#### Restful resource urls
Create - POST   - /resources
Read   - GET    - /resources/:id
Update - PATCH  - /resources/:id  *PATCH is a partial update, PUT is a full resource update
Delete - DELETE - /resources/:id

#### Middleware Patterns
Request Data validation and Middleware Flow Control - [tjmehta/dat-middleware](https://github.com/tjmehta/dat-middleware)
Middleware Flow Control - [tjmehta/middleware-flow](https://github.com/tjmehta/middleware-flow)
Middlewares of models are autogenerated for you
* Mongoose Models - /lib/middlewares/mongo/index.js - [tjmehta/mongooseware](https://github.com/tjmehta/mongooseware)
* Class Models - /lib/middlewares/apis/index.js [tjmehta/middlewarize](https://github.com/tjmehta/middlewarize) *documentation soon
Sharing the request object as a common context between middlewares allows us to make
asynchronous code look synchronous and avoid "callback hell"

#### Boom for Http Errors
Nice Http Error library - [hapijs/boom](https://github.com/hapijs/boom)



Resource Overview
=================
Mongo Schemas - /lib/models/mongo/schemas/*.js

Context Versions - a snapshot of infrastructure code version and application code version
* Dockerfile v0.1.0 and api-server v0.1.0
* Can be built on unbuilt

Infrastructure Code Versions - build file versions. Ex: Dockerfile@v0.1.0

Builds - groupings of built components component versions
* [frontend v0.1.0, api-server v0.1.0, redis v1.0.0, mongodb v2.7.0]
* Remember component versions are snapshots of BOTH infra and app code.
* This is a grouping of built docker images.

Instances - Running build which consists of running containers for each project component
* This is a grouping on running docker containers for a build's docker images.




Help and Tips
=============

### Problems npm installing?

This may be because you're getting access denied from npm - which is trying to clone a private repo (runnable-api-client)
Make sure you set up a ssh key with github and ssh-add it. (ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_rsa)
[Your github ssh keys](https://github.com/settings/ssh)

### Rapid Prototyping with Runnable-Api-Client

If you find yourself working on a feature that constantly involves updating the runnable-api-client, use npm link.
```bash
cd <runnable-api-client-path>
npm link
cd <runnable-api>
npm link runnable
# ... after you've commited some runnable-client changes and updated the version
npm run client-version # this will update the client's version to the latest in the package.json - remember to commit it.
```
```
Models:


A context represents a project context (like redis)
A version is a version of a particular context (build files, github commitHash)
 - can be built or unbuilt - built means it has docker image


A build is a grouping built versions (for all contexts of a project)

--

Instances (running builds)
 - containers (subdoc)



Pages
 - see client/config/routes.js of runnable-angular repository

Build List Page - /project/anandkumar/filibuster/master
 - has a listing of builds for an environment

Build Page - /project/anandkumar/filibuster/master/build/:id
 - is the most complex page
 - you can edit build files and create new builds
 - you can rebuild - create a new build from a build
 - shows logs if in progress, shows all logs if complete
 - [launch instance button]

Instance Page - /project/anandkumar/filibuster/master/build/:id (just like our current container pages except supports multiple containers (full instance))
 - create an instance from a build (create containers for all build images (versions))
```
